# Brand Voice

## Tone
*   **Professional but Human**: We are enterprise software, but we speak to people.
*   **Trustworthy**: We handle sensitive data; our voice should convey stability and security.
*   **Empowering**: We focus on what the user can *achieve*, not just features.

## Style Guide
*   **Active Voice**: "You can view grades" not "Grades can be viewed."
*   **Clear & Concise**: Avoid academic jargon where possible. Use "Class" instead of "Instructional Offering" in student-facing UI.
*   **Inclusive**: Use gender-neutral language.

## "No-Go" Words
*   "Module" (We use "Product Area" or "SKU")
*   "Customization" (We use "Configuration")
*   "Portal" (We use "Home" or "Dashboard")
