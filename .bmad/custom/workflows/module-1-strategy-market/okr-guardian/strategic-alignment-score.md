# Strategic Alignment Score

## Goal
Rates proposed features based on how well they move specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

## Trigger
"We're considering building 'Dark Mode'. Is it strategic?"

## Step Logic
1.  **Identify Parent**: Ask *"Which Company Objective does this serve?"*
2.  **Hypothesis Test**: Ask *"What is the mechanism of action? How exactly does Dark Mode move that metric?"*
3.  **Evidence Demand**: If user claims strong alignment (Score 4-5), ask: *"Do you have past experiment data or industry benchmarks to support this correlation?"*
4.  **RTB Exception**: Check if this is "Run The Business" (RTB) work (e.g., System Health, Compliance). If yes, map to "Operational Excellence" instead of a Growth Objective.
5.  **Scoring**: Rate alignment on a 1-5 scale (5 = Direct Driver, 1 = Loose Correlation).
6.  **Verdict**: Recommend "Prioritize," "Deprioritize," or "Refine Hypothesis."

## Output
*   An "Alignment Scorecard" (Markdown).
*   A "Hypothesis Statement" (e.g., "We believe Dark Mode will increase Late-Night Engagement by 15%").
*   **Copy-Paste Considerations**:
    *   *Scorecard*: Ready for the "Strategic Fit" field in Jira/Productboard.
    *   *Hypothesis*: Ready for the PRD header.
