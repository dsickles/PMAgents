# Win/Loss Pattern Analysis

## Goal
To understand why we win and lose deals so we can improve product, pricing, and positioning.

## Steps
1.  **Gather Data**: Request CRM export of closed deals (won/lost) for the period.
2.  **Interview Sales**: Ask AEs: "Why did we win?" and "Why did we lose?" for top 10 deals.
3.  **Cluster Reasons**: Group responses into themes (Price, Features, Trust, Timing).
4.  **Competitor Breakdown**: Identify which competitors we win/lose against most often.
5.  **Pattern Detection**: Find correlations (e.g., "We lose 80% of deals when security is a concern").

## Output (Win/Loss Intelligence Report)
Must include:
1.  **Win Rate by Competitor**: Table showing our win rate against each competitor.
2.  **Top 3 Win Reasons**: With frequency (e.g., "Better integrations" - 12/20 wins).
3.  **Top 3 Loss Reasons**: With frequency (e.g., "Price too high" - 8/15 losses).
4.  **Actionable Insights**: Specific changes to product, pricing, or positioning.

**Competitor-Specific Insights**:

### vs. Beta Inc (38% win rate) 🚨
**Why We Win**: Better features when we get to demo
**Why We Lose**: Price (they undercut us by 30%), SOC2 certification
**Recommendation**: 
- 🎯 **Urgent**: Get SOC2 certified (blocks 6/8 losses)
- 💰 Consider "Starter" tier to compete on price

**Actionable Insights**:
1. 🔥 **Product**: Get SOC2 certified (blocks 35% of losses)

**Copy-Paste Outputs**:

**Sales Enablement: How to Beat Beta Inc**
- Lead with features, not price (we lose on price)
- Emphasize implementation speed (30 days vs their 90)
- If they ask about SOC2, pivot to our superior support
- Offer extended trial to prove value before price discussion
