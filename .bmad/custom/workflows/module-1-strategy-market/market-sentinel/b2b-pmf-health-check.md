# B2B PMF Health Check

## Goal
To assess whether we have achieved Product-Market Fit in the B2B context using enterprise-grade metrics.

## Steps
1.  **Logo Retention**: Calculate % of customers who renew contracts (target: >90%).
2.  **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**: Include expansion revenue. Target: >110%.
3.  **Time to Value (TTV)**: Measure days from contract signature to first meaningful outcome (target: <90 days).
4.  **Champion Dependency**: Assess if we're dependent on one person at each account (risk indicator).
5.  **Expansion Rate**: Calculate % of customers who upgrade or buy add-ons (target: >30%).
6.  **Segment Analysis**: Break down metrics by customer segment (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB).

## Output (B2B PMF Scorecard)
Must include:
1.  **5 Core Metrics**: Logo Retention, NRR, TTV, Champion Risk, Expansion Rate.
2.  **Segment Breakdown**: Metrics by customer tier to identify where PMF is strong/weak.
3.  **Risk Flags**: Explicit callouts of champion turnover or segment underperformance.
4.  **Verdict**: Clear "Strong/Moderate/Weak PMF" assessment with rationale.

## Copy-Paste Readiness
### 1. Board Deck One-Liner
(e.g., "NRR: 118%, Logo Retention: 92%. Strong Enterprise PMF.")

### 2. Slack Alert
(e.g., "⚠️ Champion Risk: 3 key accounts lost internal advocates this quarter.")

## Audition
```markdown
**B2B PMF Health Check - Q3 2024**

**Logo Retention**: 92% ✅ (Target: >90%)
**Net Revenue Retention**: 118% ✅ (Target: >110%) - Strong expansion
**Time to Value**: 45 days ✅ (Target: <90 days)
**Champion Dependency**: ⚠️ 67% of accounts have single point of contact (Risk)
**Expansion Rate**: 34% ✅ (Target: >30%)

**Verdict**: ✅ **Strong Product-Market Fit**

**Segment Breakdown**:
- Enterprise (>$100k ACV): 125% NRR ✅ Excellent
- Mid-Market ($25k-$100k): 108% NRR ⚠️ Borderline
- SMB (<$25k): 85% NRR ❌ Weak fit, high churn

**Risk Flags**:
🚨 Champion turnover at 3 key accounts (Acme, Beta, Gamma)
🚨 Mid-Market segment not expanding - pricing issue?

**Recommendation**:
✅ Double down on Enterprise (proven fit)
⚠️ Investigate Mid-Market pricing/packaging
🚫 Consider sunsetting SMB segment (negative unit economics)

**Copy-Paste Outputs**:
- Board Deck: "NRR: 118%, Logo Retention: 92%. Strong Enterprise PMF."
- Slack Alert: "⚠️ Champion Risk: 3 key accounts lost internal advocates this quarter"
