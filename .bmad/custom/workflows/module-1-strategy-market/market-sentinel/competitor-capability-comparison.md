# Competitor Capability Comparison

## Goal
To understand how our product stacks up against competitors on specific features and identify competitive advantages or gaps.

## Steps
1.  **Target**: Ask "Which feature?" and "Which competitors?" to scope the analysis.
2.  **Search**: Scan competitor documentation, pricing pages, and product tours.
3.  **Review**: Cross-reference with user reviews (G2, Capterra, Reddit) to verify marketing claims vs. reality.
4.  **Verdict**: Output a comparison matrix with clear "Win/Lose/Tie" assessments.

## Output (Competitive Matrix)
Must include:
1.  **Feature Breakdown**: Specific capabilities, not vague claims (e.g., "Supports OAuth 2.0" not "Secure login").
2.  **Evidence Links**: Every claim must cite a source URL.
3.  **Gap Analysis**: Explicit statement of where we lead, match, or lag.

## Audition
```markdown
**Competitive Analysis: AI-Powered Search**

**Competitors Analyzed**: Acme Corp, Beta Inc.

| Feature | Us | Acme Corp | Beta Inc | Assessment |
|---------|----|-----------|-----------| ------------|
| Semantic Search | ✅ | ✅ (claimed) | ❌ | **Tie** |
| Real-time Indexing | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | **Mixed** |
| Multi-language | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | **Gap** |

**Evidence**:
- Acme Corp claims "AI-powered" but Reddit users report it's just keyword matching ([source](https://reddit.com/r/saas/xyz))
- Beta Inc has true semantic search per their technical docs ([source](https://beta.com/docs))

**Battle Card**:
- ✅ "Unlike Acme, our AI is real ML, not marketing"
- ⚠️ "We need multi-language to compete with Beta"
```
