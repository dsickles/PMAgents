# Market Opportunity Scanner

## Goal
To find "white space" opportunities where customer pain exists but solutions are inadequate.

## Steps
1.  **Scan**: Read analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester), user forums (Reddit, HackerNews), and review sites (G2, Capterra).
2.  **Cluster**: Group complaints and feature requests into themes using keyword analysis.
3.  **Rank**: Sort themes by frequency and intensity of pain.
4.  **Size the Prize**: Estimate TAM (Total Addressable Market) for each opportunity using analyst data or LinkedIn Sales Navigator.
5.  **Moat Assessment**: Rate each opportunity on "Defensibility" (Easy/Medium/Hard to copy).
6.  **Validation Plan**: Propose 3 customers to interview to confirm the pain is real.
7.  **Regulatory/Trend Drivers**: Identify external forces (regulations, tech shifts) creating the opportunity.

## Output (White Space Report)
Must include:
1.  **Top 3 Opportunities**: Ranked by market size and pain intensity.
2.  **Evidence**: Quotes from real users, analyst commentary, or review snippets.
3.  **Market Sizing**: TAM estimate with source.
4.  **Defensibility Rating**: 🛡️ (Low), 🛡️🛡️ (Medium), 🛡️🛡️🛡️ (High).
5.  **Validation Plan**: Specific customers to interview.
6.  **Trend Drivers**: Regulatory or technology changes creating urgency.

## Audition
```markdown
**Market Opportunity Scan - SaaS Analytics Space**

**Methodology**: Analyzed 500 Reddit threads, 200 G2 reviews, Gartner 2024 Analytics report

**Top 3 White Space Opportunities**:

### 1. Subscription Fatigue (High Priority)
**Pain Level**: 🔥🔥🔥 (Mentioned 347 times)
**Market Size**: ~$2.4B TAM (15% of $16B SMB analytics market - Gartner)
**Defensibility**: 🛡️🛡️ Medium (Competitors can copy pricing, but first-mover advantage)

**Evidence**:
- "I'm paying for 12 SaaS tools. I'd pay 3x for a lifetime license" - Reddit user
- Gartner: "Pricing complexity is #1 buyer complaint in 2024"

**Proposed Angle**: 
Launch a "Lifetime Pro" tier at $2,999 one-time. Target: Indie hackers and small agencies.

**Validation Plan**:
Interview 3 customers: @Acme (churned due to price), @BetaCo (downgraded), @GammaSoft (complained about annual increases)

**Regulatory/Trend Driver**: 
EU "Right to Repair" movement creating anti-subscription sentiment

### 2. Privacy-First Analytics (Medium Priority)
**Pain Level**: 🔥🔥 (Mentioned 156 times)
**Market Size**: ~$800M TAM (EU SaaS companies needing GDPR-compliant analytics)
**Defensibility**: 🛡️🛡️🛡️ High (Requires privacy-by-design architecture, hard to retrofit)

**Evidence**:
- GDPR fines totaling €2.1B in 2023 driving compliance urgency
- "We need analytics that doesn't track users" - HackerNews (247 upvotes)

**Proposed Angle**:
Position as "GDPR-native" with cookieless tracking. Get SOC2 + ISO 27001 certifications.

**Validation Plan**:
Interview EU customers who rejected Google Analytics

**Regulatory/Trend Driver**: 
New EU AI Act (2024) increasing scrutiny on data collection
