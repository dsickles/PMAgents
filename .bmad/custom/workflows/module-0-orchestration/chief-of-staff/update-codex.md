# Update Codex

## Goal
To keep the shared context layer (`.bmad/custom/context/`) up to date.

## Steps
1.  **Identify Topic**: Determine which file needs updating (e.g., "User wants to update Personas" -> `user_personas.md`).
2.  **Read Current**: Load the target markdown file.
3.  **Ask**: Ask specific questions to gather the new info (e.g., "What specific details do you want to add to 'Enterprise Admin'?").
4.  **Draft**: Create a markdown snippet of the proposed change.
5.  **Verify**: Show the snippet to the user for approval.
6.  **Write**: Append or replace the content in the file.

## Output (Markdown Snippet)
"Updated `user_personas.md`. Added:
> **Pain Point**: SSO configuration is too complex.

Is this correct?"
