# Decision Framework Selector

## Goal
To help the PM choose the right tool for a difficult decision.

## Steps
1.  **Diagnose**: Ask "Is this a prioritization problem, a role problem, or a strategy problem?"
2.  **Select**: Match to framework (Prioritization -> RICE, Role -> RACI, Strategy -> SWOT).
3.  **Explain**: Provide a template for the chosen framework.

## Output (Blank Template)
```markdown
### [Framework Name] Template
[Table or List structure ready to fill]
```

## Audition
"It sounds like you have unclear ownership. I recommend the **RACI Matrix**. Here is a template:
| Task | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| [ ]  |             |             |           |          |"
