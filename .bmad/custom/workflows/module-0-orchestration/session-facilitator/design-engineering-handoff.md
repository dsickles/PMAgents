# Design Engineering Handoff

## Goal
To ensure engineering has everything they need to build the design.

## Steps
1.  **Present**: Ask `UX Designer` to link the mockups.
2.  **Critique**: Ask `Technical Partner` for feasibility issues.
3.  **Resolve**: Facilitate negotiation on hard parts.
4.  **Sign-off**: Generate "Ready for Dev" status.

## Output (Handoff Agreement)
Must include:
1.  **Negotiated Changes**: Exactly what changed from the original design during the session.
2.  **Constraint Acknowledgement**: Explicit acknowledgement of technical constraints by the *UX Designer*.

## Copy-Paste Readiness
### 1. Slack Message
(Concise summary of the agreement + link to full notes)
Example: "✅ Handoff Complete: Feature X. Design agreed to remove animation. Dev starts Monday."

## Audition
"Handoff Time.
*   *UX Designer*: 'Here is the animated modal.'
*   *Technical Partner*: 'Animation is too heavy for mobile.'
*   **Resolution**: Remove animation on mobile? [User: Yes].
*   **Result**: Ready for Dev (Mobile: Static)."
