# Release Planning

## Goal
To lock in the scope for the upcoming release.

## Steps
1.  **Scope**: Ask `Agile Captain` for the backlog.
2.  **Risk**: Ask `Bugs Steward` for tech debt blockers.
3.  **Plan**: Draft a release candidate.
4.  **Commit**: Ask user to approve the scope.

## Output (Release Commitment Package)
Must include:
1.  **Risk Acceptance**: Explicit statement of *why* we are shipping despite known bugs.
2.  **Capacity Math**: *Agile Captain's* velocity calculation.
3.  **Scope Cuts**: What was removed from the release to hit the date?

## Copy-Paste Readiness
### 1. Kickoff Email
(Detailed "What/When/Risks" for the team)

### 2. Slide Deck
("Go/No-Go" review slides for leadership)

### 3. Confluence Page
(Release Dashboard format with "Scope" and "Risks" tables)

## Audition
"Release Planning Session.
*   *Agile Captain*: 'We can fit 5 stories.'
*   *Bugs Steward*: 'Must fix the login bug first.'
*   **Plan**: 4 Stories + Login Fix. Agreed?"
