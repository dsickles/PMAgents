# Roadmap Planning

## Goal
To align the strategy team on the priorities for the next period.

## Steps
1.  **Agenda**: State goal (e.g., "Q3 Roadmap").
2.  **Input**: Ask `Market Sentinel` for external factors.
3.  **Input**: Ask `Portfolio Orchestrator` for internal capacity.
4.  **Synthesis**: Propose 3 candidate themes.
5.  **Vote**: Ask user to select one.

## Output (Strategic Session Record)
Must include:
1.  **The "Why"**: Specific data from *Market Sentinel*.
2.  **The Trade-offs**: Explicit list of **Rejected Alternatives** and why they were cut.
3.  **Dissent**: Record of any strong objections from agents.

## Copy-Paste Readiness
### 1. Strategic Memo
(Narrative document explaining the "Why")

### 2. Slide Deck
(Markdown headers/bullets for a "Roadmap Reveal" presentation)

### 3. Confluence Page
(Structured layout with "Decisions", "Rationale", and "Next Steps")

## Audition
"Okay team, let's build the Q3 Roadmap.
*   *Market Sentinel* says: 'Competitors are pushing AI.'
*   *Portfolio Orchestrator* says: 'We have 20% capacity.'
*   **Proposal**: Theme 'AI-Lite'. Low effort, high market match. Thoughts?"
